Hey everyone 👋 !

Today I wanted to give a shoutout to a tool I do love and use almost everyday: [SCRCPY](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) !

Full or partial remote work becoming more and more a standard in every tech companies, you probably need a tool to **show your device screen to your collegues or to your client**, so here comes out !

You just have to run **only one command**: `scrcpy` in your terminal.

Just make sure your device is running at least on API 21 (Android 5.0) and you [enabled adb debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling).

You just have to install the tool on your machine and you are good to go, it **requires 0 configuration** ;)

Enjoy 🤘 !
